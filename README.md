Phlegmoirs: a text editor written in visual basic intended for simple journaling, and very quick browsing and editing of text files.

FEATURES:

* TODO: Write a features list.


EXTERNAL TOOLS:

In a well-intended effort at turd-polishing, we are doing some refactors to acknowledge that coding practices are a thing these days.

MZ-Tools 8 for VB 6.0 (https://www.mztools.com) is being helpful toward this end, and some modified configuration files are included in the tools folder here so as to stay on the same page, standards-wise. They would be inserted at roughly:

D:\AppData\Roaming\MZTools Software\MZTools8\VB6\TeamOptions

Beyond code quality analysis, it adds navigation features to the Visual Basic IDE.

X-Mouse Button Control (https://www.highrez.co.uk/downloads/xmousebuttoncontrol.htm) makes the mousewheel function in the IDE. Shared config files seem to not transfer well, but setup is trivial anyway. Profiles can be broken down to the window level so that it's not affecting, for instance, an editor window that needed fixing while also an MZ-Tools window that did not need fixing.

With some setup, VB6 is surprisingly usable in 2023 without having to drop the IDE for another code editor. It only requires *not stopping to wonder if you should*.
