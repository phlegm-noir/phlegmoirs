PHLEGMOIRS

A text editor written in visual basic intended for simple journaling, with an integrated file browser pane for efficient navigation of any file that can be loaded as text. When navigating to images it becomes an image viewer, and for other other non-textual file types it shows extended properties.

HISTORY

Phlegmoirs was first written in 2004-05, and after eons of continued use it was acknowledged that this simple tool works for this simple purpose, so we are giving it a fresh coat of paint and keeping it around.

MODERN CONTROLS FOR VB6:

As of v1.0.0, we are replacing some of the Microsoft Common Controls with [better versions](https://github.com/Kr00l/VBCCR/tree/master) created by [Krool of vbforums](https://www.vbforums.com/showthread.php?841929-VB6-ActiveX-CommonControls-(Replacement-of-the-MS-common-controls)), as permitted under the MIT License.

ICONS:

As of v0.22.0, most icons are selections from the [Fugue Icons Pack](https://www.iconarchive.com/show/fugue-icons-by-yusuke-kamiyamane.html) by [Yusuke Kamiyamane](https://p.yusukekamiyamane.com), used under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Some Fugue icons we modified, and when it's not Fugue, it's the [Farm Fresh Icons Pack](https://www.iconarchive.com/show/farm-fresh-icons-by-fatcow.html) by [Fatcow Web Hosting](https://fatcow.com/free-icons) under the same license. Older versions of Phlegmoirs were made with system icons found scattered around a Windows 2000 installation, plus originals such as the Dr. Seuss-like face in the titlebar.

EXTERNAL TOOLS:

Modifying those icons in a way that looked nice in VB6 would have been futile without the free [Junior Icon Editor](http://www.sibcode.com/junior-icon-editor/index.htm).

[MZ-Tools 8 for VB 6.0](https://www.mztools.com) adds navigation features to the Visual Basic IDE. It also does code quality analysis, and we have some configs here in the tools folder adapted to our naming conventions.

[X-Mouse Button Control](https://www.highrez.co.uk/downloads/xmousebuttoncontrol.htm) makes the mousewheel function in the IDE.

(With some setup, VB6 is surprisingly usable in 2023. It only requires *not stopping to wonder if you should*.)
